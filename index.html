        <p class="p-1 PGPH">Web development and coding is a passion of mine as it gives me the ability to plan,
            structure and
            implement
            over a
            full-scale project. I enjoy challenging myself with complex projects whilst setting myself strict deadlines
            to adhere
            to.<br /> Below are some of the replica sites that I have re-coded to test my JavaScript and CSS knowledge.
            Mac & GHD have
            complex websites with a high UX design; this gave me two exciting projects to really consolidate my
            learning.</p>
        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p class="p-2 PGPH">I wanted to re-create the Mac & GHD websites to test my JavaScript and CSS abilities, it
            gave me
            a great
            opportunity to
            put to practice the web development skills I learnt whilst studying on Udemy.Mac and GHD operate as
            e-commerce
            businesses, with a wide variety of products spread across each respective website - the large product
            catalogue and
            segmentation of products by groups added to the complexity and challenge, which I thoroughly enjoyed and i
            will be
            incorporating Javascript into both of these shortly.Both the Mac and GHD websites follow a custom format,
            which differs
            from the standard CSS grid. I built both of them using HTML and CSS.My personal project deadline to complete
            both of
            these was two weeks, this was ensuring that each page had functionality and the design, images, colour
            scheme and font
            were in-line with each businesses brand guidelines.</p>

        <p class="paid-work-p-1 PGPH">A client, a colleague of mine, had come to me with a brief for a website project
            they
            were looking for me to
            execute on.<br />
            ‚ÄçThe website was housed on Wix, which was great for me to explore the current website building tools that
            are on the
            market. It gave me an in depth insight into the limiting features that a pre-made website building tool
            restricts you
            to. Further consolidating why CSS, JavaScript and HTML are key tools to creating websites which build for
            the best
            customer experience</p>
